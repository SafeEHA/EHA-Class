    alt="a plate of the traditional Ofada rice, stew and plantain" width="300px" />

    <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of Ofada rice( brownish instead of the usual white color)</li>
        <li>40 pcs unripe habanero peppers (atarodo, ose oyibo, atarugu)</li>
        <li>2 green tatashe peppers or green bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 locust bean seasoning (Iru, ogiri okpei or dawadawa)</li>
        <li>20cl red palm oil (at least)</li>
        <li>1 big onion</li>
        <li>1 handful crayfish</li>
        <li>850g assorted meat and fish e.g (Beef, Shaki (cow tripe), Dry fish and/or Stock fish)</li>

    </ul>

    <h5>STEPS</h5>
    <h5>Stew</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and blend the peppers and the onion. Remember to remove the seeds from the green tatashe or the green
            bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Grind the crayfish and the locust bean seasoning with a dry mill.</li>
        <li>Cook all the meat and fish with the stock cube till well done.</li>
        <li>Pour the pepper blend into a separate pot and cook on high heat till all the water dries up.</li>
        <li>Pour the red palm oil into a clean dry pot and bleach till it turns clear. It should look like vegetable oil
            when done. It took me 12 minutes on low to medium heat to bleach the one in the video below. Your own time
            may vary depending on the type of heater you have and the quantity of oil.</li>
        <li>Leave the oil to cool down a bit then add the boiled pepper puree. Fry till all the water has dried from the
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the crayfish and locust bean seasoning, the orisirisi meat and fish and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste, leave to simmer and it is ready to be served.</li>

    </ol>
    <h5>Ofada Rice</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick the stones and dirt from the Ofada rice. Do this carefully as Ofada rice is known to be very dirty and
            full of stone.</li>
        <li>Pour the rice into a bowl, wash repeatedly and rinse till the water runs clean.</li>
        <li>Add 4 Cups of water, allow to cook on low to medium heat for 12 minutes. <b>Do not cover the pot
                throughout!</b></li>
        <li>Take the rice off the heat and rinse out the starch till water runs clean</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of water and cook till soft. You will need to check on it every now and then to prevent burning or
            sogginess.</li>
        <li> When its soft, take it off the heat and if you end up with liquid after the rice is fully cooked, drain in
            a colander</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="second-dish">Isi-ewu(Nigerian Goat-head Peppersoup)</h2>

    <img src="https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nigerian-isiewu.jpg"
        alt="a plate of the traditional Isi-ewu in a wooden mortar garnished with onion rings" width="300px" />

    <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Goat Head</li>
        <li>15 cl (150ml) Red Palm Oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground Ehu seeds (Calabash Nutmeg)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon powdered edible potash (Akanwu/Kaun/Keun)</li>
        <li>2 big beef flavoured stock cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>About 10 Utazi leaves (Gongronema latifolium)</li>
        <li>2 habanero peppers (or to your taste)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 onion and Utazi leaves (Gongronema latifolium) for garnishing</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>STEPS</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the goat head into pieces making sure that the essential parts: ears, tongue etc are whole cuts that is,
            they are not cut into pieces.</li>
        <li>Remove the brain and put in an aluminium foil bag then fold the bag to close just like with Nigerian Moi
            Moi.</li>
        <li>Wash the meat very well with foam and iron sponges where necessary, using a knife to scrape off the tough
            top skin especially on the tongue. There will also be traces of sooth from burning the fur off the goat,
            ensure that these are all cleaned.</li>
        <li>Put the powdered potash into a bowl. Add a small quantity of water (about 4 table spoons) and stir well.
            Pass it through a fine sieve and set the liquid aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the 2 onions into 4 big chunks.</li>
        <li>Crack and remove the outer shell of the ehu then grind with a dry mill eg coffee grinder.</li>
        <li>Pound the pepper with a mortar and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the goat head with the chunks of onion, the stock cubes and as little water as possible. Top up the
            water as necessary but make sure there is as little water as possible in the pot. This is because we do not
            want any stock in the pot when the meat is done. Remember to cook the brain too.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, slice the onion for garnishing into thin rings.</li>
        <li>Cut half of the utazi into thin slices. Cut the other half into tiny pieces. The first will be used for
            garnishing while the latter will be added into the palm oil paste.</li>
        <li>When the meat is done, remove the chunks of onion, take out the brain and mash it up till smooth.</li>
        <li>Add salt, stir and cook till all the water has dried.</li>
        <li>Set the meat aside to cool down.</li>
        <li>Now, pour the palm oil into a clean dry pot.</li>
        <li>Pour in the potash mixture (sieved) into the oil.</li>
        <li>Stir with a wooden spatula as you pour the potash. You'll notice the palm oil begin to curdle and turn
            yellow. Keep stiring till all the oil has turned yellow. Use as little potash as possible because too much
            of it can upset your stomach.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper, mashed brain, ehu seeds and the utazi that has been cut to tiny pieces. Stir very well till
            they are all incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the goat head to the palm oil paste and stir very well with a wooden spatula.</li>
        <li>Put it back on the stove/cooker and heat till the Isi Ewu is piping hot.</li>
        <li>Serve the Isi Ewu in a wooden mortar</li>
        <li>Garnish with the thin slices of utazi and onion rings for the full effects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="third-dish">Catfish Peppersoup</h2>

    <img src="https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/catfish-pepper-soup.jpg"
        alt="a plate of the Nigerian side dish (catfish peppersoup)" width="300px" />


    <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>500g Cat Fish</li>
        <li>4 Ehu or Ariwo or Calabash Nutmeg seeds</li>
        <li>Habanero Pepper(atarodo) or chilli pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>A few scent leaves</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>2 big stock cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>STEPS</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare Cat Fish Pepper Soup, wash and cut the cat fish into 1-inch thick slices. Boil some hot water and
            pour on the pieces of fish, stir and remove immediately. This toughens the skin of the fish so that it does
            not fall apart during cooking.</li>
        <li>Now it is time to prepare the 'secret' ingredient. Using an old frying pan, roast the Ehu seeds (stirring
            constantly) till you can smell it. Don't worry you will know when it is OK to take it off because it has a
            distinctive aroma. Another way to know that it is OK is to take one of the seeds and try to remove the outer
            membrane. If the membrane comes off easily, then the Ehu is done.</li>
        <li>Peel off the membrane from all the Ehu seeds and grind with a dry mill.</li>
        <li>Cut the onions into tiny pieces, wash and pick the scent leaves and tear them up with your fingers into
            small pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the pieces of fish in a pot and pour water to just cover the fish, add the stock cubes and bring to
            the boil.</li>
        <li>Once it starts to boil add the ground ehu, onions, habanero pepper(atarodo) and scent leaves and continue
            cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the catfish is done, add salt to taste and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes and it's ready!</li>
