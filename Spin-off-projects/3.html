    <p>The struggles we go through as young adults in Nigeria is sickening to even think about, the disadvantages we're at and how we suffer striving to survive.<br> </br>Ontop of all that there's the pressure to not bring shame/disgrace to your family. Whatever you do, that has to be on the forefront of your mind.<br></br> Its not easy for anyone (young, old, disabled, poor, average even the rich) in Nigeria if i am being honest, that was why i created this blog. <br></br>I know alot of us aren't exactly willing to share our problems but i'm going to be putting my stories here just incase it helps a random reader, <br></br>Just so he/she knows theres someone out there that genuinely understands and can maybe work with to provide a lasting solution.</p>

    <h2 id="story">About me</h2>
<hr style="width:75%; stroke-dasharray: 10px; margin-left:3">

<p>My name is Safe, i am a struggling Nigerian youth, i love warm baths (i think its therapeutic), i love listening to gists, i am a hopeless romantic,<br> </br>My favorite food is Yam and egg sauce (don't judge me, lol), i enjoy spending time with the people i care about, i love parties, dancing and singing.<br></br> I love writing (obvi) and reading, i don't like stress. If you love me just waya my aza (always), i am shy around new people but be very afraid when i get comfortable...</p>

<h2  id="draft">My journey Into Tech</h2>
<hr style="width:75%; margin-left:3">

<p>I have the smartest tech person i know as a friend and he inspired me to say the least, he sent the link to this training infact.<br> </br>The eHA Academy Female Only Cohort has been like a dream come true for me. i remember how much i panicked on the first zoom call, <br></br>i didn't stay the full 3 hours so i was freaking out on how i'll catch up. Amazingly everything has been running smoothly since then. <br></br>My mentor especially has been very helpful, the few other students i've interacted with have also been so amazing, and so far i've learnt so much.<br></br> The most intriguing part about the courses is building so many texts and colors from a blank page. My proudest moment is always when i find a "bug" <br></br>Or hit save and see wonders on my webpage. I am once again scared of the next Module but i have faith.</br> </p>
